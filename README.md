# regren

Cleanup your Docker registry using REST and native tools.



**NOTE: This is a beta release, we do not consider it completely production ready yet. Use at your own risk.**

Delivering software is what we love. Running out of disk space prevents us from doing so.
regren helps tidying up your private registry by removing old images. 

## Using regren
regren extends the official Docker Registry image by some cleanup scripts.
You can use this image to deploy your registry and run the script from inside or run it as a standalone container on-demand.
